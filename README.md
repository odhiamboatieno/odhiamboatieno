## 👋 About Me

I’m **Odhiambo Atieno**, a professional **Software Engineer from Kenya** who builds **real‑world systems**, not demos.

I specialize in designing, building, and self‑hosting **scalable, production‑ready software** — from backend architectures to mobile apps and full DevOps pipelines.

I’m the **Founder & CEO of [Seen Technologies](https://seentechs.com)**, where we build, deploy, and maintain digital products for clients who care about **performance, ownership, and long‑term stability**.

I’m deeply opinionated about:

* ✅ Open‑source over lock‑in
* ✅ Automation over manual work
* ✅ Systems that scale cleanly
* ✅ Brutal honesty over hype

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

<p align="right">
  <img width="220" src="https://github.com/odhiamboatieno/odhiamboatieno/blob/main/icon/what-ilove.gif?raw=true">
</p>

I build and ship **end‑to‑end systems**, including:

* **Backend Systems** (Laravel, APIs, Auth, Payments, Licensing)
* **Mobile Apps** (Flutter, Android, iOS)
* **Self‑Hosted Infrastructure** (Docker, Ubuntu, VPS, Bare‑metal)
* **Automation & Tooling** (CI/CD, background jobs, monitoring)
* **Multi‑tenant & SaaS platforms**
* **SEO‑driven, high‑performance web platforms**

If it runs in production, breaks under load, or needs to scale — that’s my territory.

## 🌍 My Engineering Philosophy

* Open‑source **first**, proprietary only when necessary
* Own your **data, infrastructure, and roadmap**
* Design for **failure**, not perfection
* Ship fast, then harden
* Build things that still make sense **5 years later**

I actively contribute to and support open‑source projects, and I enjoy collaborating with engineers from different backgrounds and cultures.
